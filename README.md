## Why

An old phone already has everything a security camera needs: a decent sensor, a
hardware H.264/H.265 encoder, Wi-Fi, a battery that doubles as a UPS, and a torch for
night use. This app turns that hardware into a standards-compliant RTSP source that any
NVR can consume, and keeps every frame on your own network.

---

## Features

### Streaming
- **RTSP server** on port `8554`, low latency over Wi-Fi
- **Hardware-accelerated codecs** — H.264, H.265 (HEVC), AV1, with automatic fallback to
  H.264 when the selected codec cannot be prepared
- **Resolutions** from 640×480 up to the camera's maximum (capped at 4K to stay within
  encoder limits), with bitrate scaled to the resolution
- **Optional audio** — off by default, so the app does not claim the microphone unless
  you ask it to
- **Background operation** via a foreground service; keeps streaming with the screen off
- **Front/back camera switching**, from the app, the dashboard, or the API

### Monitoring
- **Web dashboard** on port `8081` — live preview, every setting, battery and Wi-Fi status

### Overlays and camera control
- Timestamp and date overlay, positionable in any corner, three text sizes
- Torch control, plus a **night mode** that switches the torch on automatically using the
  ambient light sensor
- Digital zoom control via slider, in both the app and the web dashboard

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    CAM[Camera2 + OpenGL surface] --> ENC[Hardware encoder<br/>H.264 / H.265 / AV1]
    CAM --> SNAP[JPEG snapshot loop<br/>throttled when idle]

    ENC --> RTSP[RTSP server<br/>:8554]
    SNAP --> WEB[Web server<br/>:8081]

    RTSP --> NVR[VLC / OBS / Frigate / NVR]
    WEB --> BROWSER[Browser dashboard]
```

Everything runs inside one foreground service. The RTSP stream comes straight off the
hardware encoder; the dashboard shares a single JPEG capture loop, which idles
automatically when nobody is watching.

| Component | File |
|---|---|
| Foreground service, camera, stream lifecycle | `CctvServerService.kt` |
| HTTP server and dashboard | `WebServer.kt` |
| Authentication, CSRF and HTML escaping | `WebAuth.kt` |
| Settings | `AppPreferences.kt` |

---

## Quick start

1. **Install** the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/Zektopic/RSTP-CCTV-App/releases),
   or [build it yourself](#building-from-source).
2. **Grant permissions** on first launch — Camera, and *Display over other apps*
   (required to keep the camera surface alive in the background). Notifications and
   Microphone are optional.
3. **Note the generated dashboard password.** On first run the app creates a random
   password for the web dashboard and shows it to you once. It is also visible any time
   under *Authentication*.
4. **Configure** resolution, codec and any overlays you want.
5. **Toggle the server on.** The app shows the RTSP and dashboard URLs.
6. **Connect** from any client on the same network.

> [!TIP]
> Leave the phone plugged in. Encoding video continuously is a heavy, sustained load and
> will drain a battery in a few hours.

## Connecting a client

```
rtsp://<phone-ip>:8554/stream                 # no authentication
rtsp://<user>:<pass>@<phone-ip>:8554/stream   # with authentication enabled
```

| Client | How |
|---|---|
| **VLC** | Media → Open Network Stream → paste the RTSP URL |
| **ffplay** | `ffplay -fflags nobuffer rtsp://<phone-ip>:8554/stream` |
| **OBS** | Add a *Media Source*, uncheck *Local File*, paste the URL |
| **Home Assistant** | Generic Camera integration, or `go2rtc` |
| **Frigate** | Add as an `ffmpeg` input under `cameras:` |

The web dashboard lives at `http://<phone-ip>:8081`.

---

## Security

This app puts a camera on your network. The defaults are chosen accordingly.

### What is protected

| Control | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Web dashboard authentication | **On** | HTTP Basic. A strong password is generated on first run. |
| RTSP authentication | Off | Enable under *Authentication*; applies to the RTSP stream. |
| Cross-origin requests | **Rejected** | Stops a website you visit from driving the camera over your LAN. |
| Credentials in cloud backup | **Excluded** | Preferences and snapshots are excluded from Auto Backup and device transfer. |
| Audio capture | **Off** | The microphone is only claimed when you enable it. |
| Start on boot | **Off** | Opt-in. |
| Start when app opens | **Off** | Opt-in. Opening the app no longer starts streaming by itself. |

### What you should still do

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Never port-forward this app to the internet.** Both servers speak plaintext — RTSP
>   and HTTP, no TLS. Use a VPN (WireGuard, Tailscale) to reach it from outside.
> - **Keep dashboard authentication on** unless you are on a network you fully trust.
>   With it off, anyone who can reach port 8081 can watch the camera and change settings.
> - **Use a dedicated IoT VLAN or guest network** if your router supports it.

### Signing key rotation

> [!WARNING]
> The release signing key used before version 1.1.0 was committed to this public
> repository and **must be considered compromised**. It has been removed and replaced.
>
> **If you installed a release built before 1.1.0, you must uninstall it before
> installing a newer one.** Android refuses to update an app across a change of signing
> key, so the install will otherwise fail with a signature mismatch. Your settings will
> be lost; the RTSP and dashboard passwords need to be set again.

### Reporting a vulnerability

Please open a [security advisory](https://github.com/Zektopic/RSTP-CCTV-App/security/advisories/new)
rather than a public issue.

---

## HTTP API

Base URL `http://<phone-ip>:8081`.

**Authentication.** When the dashboard is secured (the default), every endpoint requires
HTTP Basic credentials and returns `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate` header otherwise.

```bash
curl -u admin:<password> http://192.168.1.50:8081/status
```

**Verbs.** State-changing endpoints accept `POST` (preferred) and `GET` (kept for
compatibility with existing scripts and NVR integrations). Requests carrying a
cross-origin `Origin` header are rejected with `403`.

### Read

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | The dashboard |
| `GET /shot.jpg` | Current JPEG snapshot |
| `GET /status` | JSON status: streaming state, codec, resolution, every setting, battery, Wi-Fi |

### Write

| Endpoint | Parameters |
|---|---|
| `POST /action/toggle-stream` | — |
| `POST /action/switch-camera` | — |
| `POST /action/set-codec` | `codec=H264\|H265\|AV1` |
| `POST /action/set-resolution` | `w=<int>&h=<int>` (`0x0` = camera maximum) |
| `POST /action/set-setting` | `key=<key>&value=<value>` |
| `POST /action/set-auth` | `enabled=<bool>&username=<s>&password=<s>` |

<details>
<summary><b>Keys accepted by <code>/action/set-setting</code></b></summary>

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `show_timestamp` | bool | Timestamp overlay |
| `show_date` | bool | Date overlay |
| `timestamp_position` | `Top Left` \| `Top Right` \| `Bottom Left` \| `Bottom Right` | Overlay corner |
| `timestamp_size` | `Small` \| `Medium` \| `Large` | Overlay text size |
| `flashlight_enabled` | bool | Torch |
| `night_mode_enabled` | bool | Automatic torch by ambient light |
| `zoom_level` | float 1.0–8.0 | Camera digital zoom factor |
| `force_software` | bool | Prefer the software encoder |
| `show_preview` | bool | On-device preview overlay |
| `audio_enabled` | bool | Include microphone audio in the stream |
| `web_auth_enabled` | bool | Require authentication on port 8081 |

</details>

---

## Permissions

| Permission | Required | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `CAMERA` | **Yes** | Capturing video. Without it the server will not start. |
| `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` | **Yes** | The camera renders into an off-screen overlay surface, which is what keeps encoding alive when the app is not in the foreground. |
| `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` | **Yes** | Starting the server also asks to be exempted from battery optimization — without it, OEM battery management is free to kill the camera in the background. |
| `INTERNET`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | Yes | Running the local RTSP and HTTP servers, and reporting the device IP. |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA` | Yes | Long-running capture. |
| `RECORD_AUDIO`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` | Only with audio on | Audio is opt-in; the microphone type is only claimed when you enable it. |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Recommended | Android 13+. Without it the service notification is suppressed and you lose the visible indicator that the camera is live. |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Only with start-on-boot | Restarting after a reboot. |
| `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` | Optional | Wi-Fi signal readout on the dashboard. |

No internet permission is used to send data anywhere. Nothing leaves your network.

## Building from source

**Requirements:** JDK 21, Android SDK with API 36, Android Studio (Ladybug or newer) or
the command line.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zektopic/RSTP-CCTV-App.git
cd RSTP-CCTV-App

./gradlew testDebugUnitTest    # 32 unit tests
./gradlew lintDebug
./gradlew assembleDebug        # app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
```

### Building a signed release

The release keystore is **not** in this repository and never will be. Provide credentials
one of two ways.

**Locally** — create `keystore.properties` in the repository root (it is git-ignored):

```properties
storeFile=/absolute/path/to/release.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=release
keyPassword=...
```

**In CI** — set these repository secrets:

| Secret | Contents |
|---|---|
| `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | `base64 -w0 release.jks` |
| `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
| `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias |
| `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` | Key password |

Without credentials the release build still succeeds and produces
`app-release-unsigned.apk`, so forks and pull requests are never blocked on secrets.

Releases are published by pushing a `v*` tag or running the *Android Release* workflow
manually — not on every commit to `master`.

> [!NOTE]
> Dependency versions are pinned in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Do not reintroduce
> `master-SNAPSHOT` coordinates: a moving snapshot previously upgraded RootEncoder
> underneath the project and broke a build whose CI had already passed.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>The server will not start</b></summary>

Check that both Camera and *Display over other apps* are granted. The overlay permission
is not a normal runtime permission — it has to be enabled from
Settings → Apps → RTSP CCTV App → Display over other apps.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The stream is black, or the client cannot connect</b></summary>

- Confirm the phone and the client are on the same network and the network is not using
  AP isolation (common on guest Wi-Fi).
- Try 640×480 with H.264 first — some devices cannot prepare H.265 or AV1 at high
  resolutions, and the app falls back to H.264 when preparation fails.
- Check the notification is present; if it is gone, the OS killed the service.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The dashboard asks for a password I do not have</b></summary>

Open the app and look under *Authentication* — the generated username and password are
shown there. You can also turn *Secure Web Dashboard* off, though that leaves the camera
open to everyone on the network.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Streaming stops when the screen turns off</b></summary>

Toggling the server on already prompts you to exempt the app from battery optimization —
make sure you accepted that dialog. Some OEMs (worst on Xiaomi/MIUI, Huawei, Oppo and
Samsung) still kill the camera in the background regardless; on Xiaomi also enable
*Autostart*. See [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com) for per-vendor steps.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Start-on-boot does not work</b></summary>

Android 14+ blocks background components from starting a camera foreground service. The
app detects this and posts a *tap to resume* notification instead of crashing. Some OEMs
block autostart outright regardless of the setting.
</details>

## Roadmap

- [ ] HTTPS/TLS for the dashboard, so credentials are not sent in plaintext
- [ ] Enable R8 for release builds (needs keep rules for the reflection-heavy
      RootEncoder dependency, plus an on-device verification pass)
- [ ] ONVIF discovery so NVRs can find the camera automatically
- [ ] Continuous recording with a rolling buffer
- [ ] Multi-camera management from one dashboard

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome.

- Run `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lintDebug` before opening a PR — CI runs both.
- Add tests for logic that can be tested on the JVM. Keeping such logic free of Android
  imports (as in `WebAuth`) is deliberate.
- Never commit keystores, passwords or `keystore.properties`.
